# @macalinao/solana-errors

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 548a2d6: Add support for `@solana/kit` v7.

  The `@solana/kit` peer dependency range widens from `^6` to `^6 || ^7`, so this is not a
  breaking change — projects still on kit 6 keep working, and projects on kit 7 are now
  supported. Every package is typechecked and tested against both majors.

  The Solana program clients used internally move to their kit-7 releases:

  - `@solana-program/address-lookup-table` `^0.12.1` -> `^0.13.0`
  - `@solana-program/system` `^0.12.2` -> `^0.13.0`
  - `@solana-program/token` `^0.14.0` -> `^0.15.0`

  These declare `@solana/kit: ^7.0.0` as their own peer, so on kit 6 your package manager
  will warn about an unsatisfied peer range for them. Their types are compatible with kit 6
  in the ways Grill uses them, but kit 7 is the recommended target.

  No Grill APIs changed. None of the APIs removed in kit 7 (`ReactiveStreamStore`'s
  construction-time `abortSignal` and auto-connect, `getUnifiedState`,
  `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` from `@solana/kit`, `createEmptyClient`) were used
  by these packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d482b80: Add @macalinao/solana-errors package for formatting Solana transaction and instruction errors in production without the `__DEV__` flag, and use it in gill-extra's transaction error handling.
